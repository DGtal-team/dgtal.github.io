The DGtal project (http://dgtal.org) has received the software award at the Symposium on Geometry Processing 2016 (june 20th-24th, Berlin).

The price acknowledge a high quality open-source software dedicated to the geometry processing of shapes. The collaborative DGtal project has become crucial in the internaiton digital geometry community with many contributions from various teams in this topic.

Taking into account the elegantly structured code, the ease with which users can interface into the code-base, and the varied scope of applications, the <a href="http://awards.geometryprocessing.org">SGP Software Award</a> Committee have decided that this software package is the most deserving of the candidates considered.

We would like to thank the community and all developers that help us on this project.
