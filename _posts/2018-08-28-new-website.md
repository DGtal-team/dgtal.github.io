The DGtal website has been updated to a more modern and responsive site.

The previous provider was the [LIRIS](http://liris.cnrs.fr) lab with a wordpress infrastructure. We have now switched to a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) framework with Jekyll and HTTPS support.

We hope you'll envoy the new version. Please report any problem as a [Github issue](https://github.com/DGtal-team/dgtal.github.io/issues/new).
