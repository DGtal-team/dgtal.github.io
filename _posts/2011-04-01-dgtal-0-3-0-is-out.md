Beside the DGtal presentation at DGCI 2011, we are pleased to announce a new DGtal release 0.3.0. **New features:** 
*   User-guide added (based on doxygen system)
*   Kernel: new concepts and controls to enhance the Interger type management, new iterators (Range/SubRange) on HyperRectDomains.
*   Topology: interpixel model added (cells, boundary tracking mechanisms,...)
*   Geometry 2D: 2D curve primitive decomposition, tangential cover, convexity/concavity decomposition.
*   Geometry nD: reverse Euclidean distance transformation
*   Visualisation: stream mechanism to visualize 3D DGtal objects with libQGLViewer (optional)
*   Shape generator factory added in nD

**BugFixes, enhancements:** 
*   Many bugs have been fixed for this release.
*   cmake DGtal dependency checking process is more stable now

**Known problems:** 
*   For technical reasons, we haven't be able to verify that this release also compile on Windows Visual Studio systems (see ticket [#87][1]). A new release will fix this problem as soon as possible.
*   [All open tickets][2]
