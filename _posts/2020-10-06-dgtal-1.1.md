We are really excited to share with you the release 1.1 of DGtal. It has been a while since the last
official release and the 1.1 release contains many interesting features. In the following, we just mention
couple of them but please have a look to the [Changelog](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/blob/master/ChangeLog.md)
for a complete overview.

# Geometry processing

* ![Video](../img/regularization.mp4), This video showcases:
   * a quad mesh reconstruction from a low resolution voxel set using [DigitalSurfaceRegularization](https://dgtal-team.github.io/doc-nightly/moduleRegularization.html),
   * from normal vectors obtained from [Integral Invariants](https://dgtal-team.github.io/doc-nightlya/moduleIntegralInvariant.html) which have been piecewise smooth regularized using the [Ambrosio-Tortorelli functional](https://dgtal-team.github.io/doc-nightly/moduleGenericAT.html),
   * and visualized in [polyscope-dgtal](https://github.com/dcoeurjo/polyscope-dgtal).
