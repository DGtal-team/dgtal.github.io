Only 3 days after the last release, here you have a minor set of changes which fixes build problems on linux. Here you have the Changelog: 
*   Build bugfixes (linux/mac)
*   New doc added (prelim. version): "Cellular grid space and topology,cells, digital surfaces"
*   New example on domain range

**Important** 
*   Repo cleanup: presentations, posters, etc.. have been removed from the trunk to the folder https://svn.liris.cnrs.fr/dgtal/presentations (too large image eps files). If you want to get the slides/presentations, you will need to do a brand new checkout :

`
svn checkout https://svn.liris.cnrs.fr/dgtal/presentations
