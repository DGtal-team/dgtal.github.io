title: DGtal release 1.2
---

We are really excited to share with you the [release  1.2 of DGtal](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/releases/tag/1.2) and its tools. As usual, all edits and bugfixes are listed in the  [Changelog](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/blob/master/ChangeLog.md), and we would like to thank all devs involved in this release. In this short review, we would like to focus on only few of them.

## Python binding

Yes.. it has been quite a long requested feature and we are pleased to introduce you the brand new (partial) python binding (kudos [Pablo Hernandez-Cerdan](https://github.com/phcerdan)). At this point, only a few collections of classes/functions are available in the binding (mostly, basic kernels, some image containers and many topology classes), but everything is set up for further improvements.

To give you a glimpse, just

```
pip3 install dgtal
```

and then here you have just a quick example of the computation of the Euler characteristic and simple point tests on random sets:

```python
import dgtal
import random

Point  = dgtal.kernel.Point3D
Domain = dgtal.kernel.DomainZ3i
Set    = dgtal._dgtal.kernel.DigitalSetZ3i

dom    = Domain( Point(0,0,0), Point(10,10,10))
mySet  = Set(dom)

# Random set
for i in range(50*50):
  mySet.insert(Point(random.randint(0,10),random.randint(0,10),random.randint(0,10)))

# Digital Object (with topology)
Object = dgtal.topology.Object26_6
Topo   = Object.TDigitalTopology
FAdj   = Topo.TForegroundAdjacency
BAdj   = Topo.TBackgroundAdjacency
fadj   = FAdj()
badj   = BAdj()
topo   = Topo(fadj, badj)
obj    = Object(topo,mySet)

# Checking the simple points
cptSimple=0
for p in mySet:
    if obj.isSimple(p):
        cptSimple += 1
print("Number of simple points: "+str(cptSimple)+ " / " + str(mySet.size()))

# Cubical Complex
kspace   = dgtal.topology.KSpace3D()
ccomplex = dgtal.topology.CubicalComplex3D(kspace)
ccomplex.construct(mySet)

print("Euler characteristic: "+str(ccomplex.euler()))
```

To learn more about the binding, please check this 
[Pull-Request](https://github.com/DGtal-team/DGtal/pull/1528). Please note that all python objects have a pretty self-exploratory documentation. Just use `ipython` to inspect the objects.


## Geometry

Many new features on the Geometry package, including [plane probing based normal vector estimators](https://dgtal-team.github.io/doc-nightly/modulePlaneProbing.html), and the [Quickhull](https://dgtal-team.github.io/doc-nightly/moduleQuickHull.html) algorithm in arbitrary dimensional lattice space, used to speed-up the new [convexity package](https://dgtal-team.github.io/doc-nightly/moduleDigitalConvexity.html) that was introduced in the release 1.1.
