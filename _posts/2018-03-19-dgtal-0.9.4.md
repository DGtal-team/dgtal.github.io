    * VoxelComplex: an extension for CubicalComplex, implementing the Critical-Kernels framework, based on the work of M.Couprie and G.Bertrand on isthmus
    * Adding the half-edge data structure to represent arbitrary two-dimensional combinatorial surfaces with or without boundary and helpers to create meshes from digital surfaces
    * Laplace-Beltrami operators on digital surfaces (Best Student Paper DGCI2018)
